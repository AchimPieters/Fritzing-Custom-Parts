Fritzing is a great open source tool for anyone to teach, share, and prototype their electronic projects! It allows you to design a schematic, and thus a part, which can then be added to very professional-looking wiring diagrams. You can even design your own PCBs and have them fabricated from the files you design. At <b>Studio</b>Pieters®, we use Fritzing in the blogs, our hook-up guides, and any other place we need to show how to hook-up our boards to other hardware.
